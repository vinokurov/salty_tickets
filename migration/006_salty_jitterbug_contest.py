The last Salty Monday of the season will feature the Salty Jitterbugs Contest! 
We will have a "Showdown" format where 2 couples dance eight 8s with only one couple advancing immediately to the next round.
The last 2 couples dance spotlights, then all skates.
The music will be live and it will be fast! Any dance style goes!
Judging is performed by the audience via an online voting system.<br>

The winning couple will get tickets for our Salty Recipes workshop with Pol & Sara end of July: 
either 1 session of aerials as a couple or 50% discount for Shag as a couple.
