        <p>This time we are bringing the super stars of the European St.Louis Shag scene, straight from Vilnius,
            Simona Pogosian and Rokas Borusevičius!
            We can't stop enjoying their crazy energy and style.
            They have been one of the few headliners spreading St.Louis Shag
            in Europe and making this awesome dance popular!
            Now they are coming to London!</p>

       <p>We will have 2 classes on St.Louis Shag.
           Both classes are aimed for improvers/intermediate swing dancers.
           The first one "Potato Pancakes" will be good for the dancers who have no or little experience
           with St.Louis Shag or those who want to refresh their fundamentals.
           It will cover the basics and move on to the more complicated material.
           The second class "Zeppelins" will focus on extending the Shag repertoire
           and will assume that you are either familiar with St.Louis Shag or have attended the first class.</p>

       <p>You don't need a partner to sign up,
           however signing up together will let you avoid the waiting list if there is one.</p>

       <p>To give you a perfect experience during the workshop we will limit the capacity to <b>just 30 places</b>
       and will limit the balance between leads and followers.</p>

       <p>As a gratitude to those who supported our first Salty Recipes we offer a special discount price to all
       of the attendants of the recipes with Pol & Sara. Also there is a discount for the first 15 registered and
       a discount for those who book both olive oil and spinach recipes.</p>
