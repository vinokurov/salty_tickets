              Now in its 3rd year, Mind the Shag is a one-of-a-kind celebration of dancing and music.
Our wonderful teachers have provided blocks of 2-hour classes. Like last year, you can book these as a whole track or individual stations.
And of course we will have parties.
A truly exciting lineup of bands and DJs awaits you in some fantastic venues. Like the last two years,
Mind the Shag is all about working hard on your new steps during the day and letting loose in a relaxed environment in the evenings.
