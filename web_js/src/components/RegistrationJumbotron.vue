              Now in its 4th year, Mind the Shag is a one-of-a-kind celebration of dancing and music.
Our wonderful teachers have provided blocks of 2-hour classes. Like last year, you can book these as a whole track or individual stations.
And of course we will have parties. This year we have also added daytime activities: a unique Regents canal boat trip with live band on board,
and a Sunday roast. You can choose daytime activities and mix them with the stations.
