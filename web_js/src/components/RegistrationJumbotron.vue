                In order to keep a good ratio between leads and followers in the classes we might need to apply waiting list.
                In the registration form below options that are wait listed are indicated with orange colour.
                <br/><br/>
                We did our best to make waiting lists as efficient as possible.
                We are balancing registrations automatically and accept dancers off the waiting lists as soon as possible.

                <br/><br/>
                If you are getting on the waiting list, you can choose
                <ul>
                  <li>Pay the whole amount in advance. You can choose to cancel your waiting listed registration and get refunded any moment.
                  </li>
                  <li>Leave your card details and let us charge you as soon as the place gets available. You can cancel any time while you are on the waiting list.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Please note, that we don't keep any of your card details in our system and we don't have access to your sensitive information.
                For all payment transactions we are using Stripe API.

            <p class="card-text mb-3" style="max-width: 50rem;">
                If you are signing up with a partner, you are guaranteed to avoid waiting lists.
                There are 2 ways to do that.
                <ul>
                  <li>Book for both youself and your partner (use "Couple" button) and pay for both in one transaction.</li>
                  <li>Sign up separately. The second one will need to specify partner token of the first one. <br/>[THIS OPTION IS NOT AVAILABLE YET]</li>
                </ul>
